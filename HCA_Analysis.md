**Project description:** The U.S. Healthcare industry is one of few multi-billion dollar industries that has the potential to leverage data and analytics in order to directly benefit individual's quality of life. Through sophisticated machine-learning models and precise analytics data-professionals can help both healthcare insurance payors and providers decrease medical costs and increase overall patient quality of care.  

The goal of this project is to highlight one application of supervised machine-learning that can be used to model patient healthcare costs. Currently, healthcare insurance providers use an approach to modeling risk-adjustment using HCC grouping logic (<a href = "https://www.aapc.com/risk-adjustment/risk-adjustment.aspx">click here to learn more</a>).
