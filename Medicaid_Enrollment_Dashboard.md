**Project description:** The Covid-19 pandemic has continued to have lasting effects on the U.S. healthcare industry. One of these effects has been a significant increase in federal and state healthcare assistance programs such as Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). In order to better visualize the nationwide increases in enrollment I created this dashboard which allows users to track enrollment over time and compare enrollment before and after the 2020 pandemic.
